- New features

#### MAJOR (0.2.0 â†’ 1.0.0)

## Release Process

### 1. Update Version

```

### 2. Commit and Push
```bash

    Exactly! You've got it! ðŸŽ¯ 

## Yes, this is the FINAL step after ALL your changes

The process is:

### During Development (multiple commits):
```bash
# Make changes, commit, push as many times as needed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new function"
git push origin main

# More changes...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
git push origin main

# Even more changes...
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update README"
git push origin main
```

### When Ready to Release (FINAL step):
```bash
# 1. Decide "OK, this is ready for a release"
# 2. Update version
vim Charts/fennel-node/Chart.yaml  # 0.1.0 â†’ 0.1.1

# 3. Commit the version bump
git add Charts/fennel-node/Chart.yaml
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.1"
git push origin main

# 4. Create the release tag (the "v" indicates official release)
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Release v0.1.1: Enhanced trust pallet, fixed issues, updated docs"
git push origin v0.1.1
```

## The "v" prefix is a convention that:
- âœ… **Triggers** the release workflow
- âœ… **Creates** GitHub Release
- âœ… **Tags** Docker image with version
- âœ… **Publishes** Helm chart
- âœ… **Signals** to users "this is an official release"

## Think of it like:
- **Regular commits** = Work in progress
- **Tag with "v"** = "Ship it! ðŸš€"

So yes, you can make as many commits as you want during development. Only when you're ready to create an official release do you:
1. Bump the version
2. Create a tag with "v" prefix
3. Push the tag

This creates a clear distinction between development work and official releases!
