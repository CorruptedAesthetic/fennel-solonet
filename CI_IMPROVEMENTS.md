# CI/CD Improvements for Fennel Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the CI/CD pipeline to align with Polkadot SDK ecosystem best practices and resolve the GitHub Actions cache blob error.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. GitHub Actions Cache Blob Error
**Problem**: `BlobNotFound` error when using GitHub Actions cache
**Solution**: Removed problematic cache settings (`cache-from: type=gha`, `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max`) that were causing the blob not found error.

### 2. Dockerfile Complexity
**Problem**: Overly complex multi-stage Dockerfile with cargo-chef and srtool stages causing build failures
**Solution**: Simplified Dockerfile following Polkadot SDK patterns:
- Single builder stage using `paritytech/ci-unified:latest`
- Removed cargo-chef complexity
- Moved srtool build to CI workflow (better practice)
- Final stage uses `parity/base-bin:latest`

### 3. Missing Standard Actions
**Problem**: Repository lacked standard GitHub Actions used across Polkadot SDK ecosystem
**Solution**: Created standard action files:
- `.github/actions/free-disk-space/action.yml`
- `.github/actions/ubuntu-dependencies/action.yml`
- `.github/actions/macos-dependencies/action.yml`

## Key Improvements

### 1. Standardized Disk Space Management
- Uses `jlumbroso/free-disk-space@54081f138730dfa15788a46383842cd2f914a1be` action
- Removes Android SDK (~12GB) while preserving other tools
- Consistent with Polkadot SDK practices

### 2. Simplified Docker Build
- Removed complex multi-stage builds that caused cache issues
- Follows standard Polkadot SDK Dockerfile patterns
- Better error handling and reduced complexity

### 3. Updated Workflows
- **CI Workflow**: Removed deprecated `actions-rs/toolchain`, added proper Rust caching
- **Release Workflow**: Simplified and standardized
- **Publish Workflow**: Fixed cache issues, maintained srtool integration

### 4. Improved .dockerignore
- Comprehensive exclusions to reduce build context size
- Follows Polkadot SDK patterns
- Excludes CI/CD files, documentation, and build artifacts

## Polkadot SDK Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Dependency Management
- Use `paritytech/ci-unified:latest` for builds
- Use `parity/base-bin:latest` for runtime images
- Standard Ubuntu/macOS dependency installation

### 2. Rust Configuration
- Use `rustup update stable --no-self-update`
- Add `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Use `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for caching

### 3. Build Optimization
- Use `SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1` for faster CI builds
- Proper timeout settings (90 minutes for builds)
- Concurrent job execution where possible

### 4. Security and Standards
- Minimal attack surface in final Docker images
- Proper user permissions and data directories
- Standard port exposures (30333, 9933, 9944, 9615)

### 5. Deterministic Builds
- srtool integration for deterministic WASM builds
- WASM hash labeling for traceability
- Chain specification generation and management

## Testing the Changes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test Docker build
docker build . -t fennel-node

# Test node functionality
docker run --rm fennel-node --version
```

### CI Testing
- Push changes to a feature branch
- Verify all CI jobs pass
- Check Docker image builds successfully
- Validate chain specs are generated

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- Docker build process simplified (faster, more reliable)
- Some intermediate build artifacts no longer available
- Cache behavior changed (more reliable, less aggressive)

### Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Runtime WASM still built deterministically
- Chain specifications still generated
- Helm charts still packaged

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor CI Performance**: Track build times and success rates
2. **Optimize Further**: Consider additional optimizations based on usage patterns
3. **Documentation**: Update README with new build instructions
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all CI paths
